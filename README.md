# DependencyWalker

Show dependencies tree for .NET assemblies like old [Depend Walker](http://www.dependencywalker.com/) show it for non managed applications.

To quickly start to use it, get latest [DependWalker.zip](https://github.com/isindicic/DependencyWalker.Net/releases/download/1.0/DependencyWalker.zip) and unzip it somewhere.
Simply execute DependWalker.exe with assembly filename as command line argument or just execute DependWalker.exe from explorer and then assembly using user interface. 

To successfully compile solution you'll need Visual Studio 2010. 

Solution targets .NET 4.0 and application require such framework version installed in order to run. However, application can work with assemblies that target lower version of framework without any problems.
